@usairways Does anyone know the hold times for USAirways reservations?

@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?
@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...

@USAirways How will I change it?
@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?
@USAirways flight 1783 CLT to BOS
@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
